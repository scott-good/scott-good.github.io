HOW TO USE THIS

Viewing this example is very simple.

1. You've already found this document, so you're in the right folder on Google Drive...except you can't test it from there. At least I can't.

2. DOWNLOAD the whole folder (go back up a level to do this) to your computer.

3. Open the "Custom Schedule Dialog" folder on your computer (it's probably in Downloads)

4. Double-click the Base.html file. This will launch it into your browser.

5. Test away!
